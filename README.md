Final Project for CSCE 470 by Brian, Jason, and William  
[fanhype.appspot.com](http://fanhype.appspot.com/)



Installation
============

- Create a new Google App Engine thing
- Navigate to the fanhype directory (lowercase)
- Click 'Run' and then click 'Browse' to open the page

Setup
=====

- Click the 'New Game' link in the navigation bar
- Enter the information for one of the games as provided in game_setup.txt
- When everything is correctly entered, click 'Create New Game'
- After the game has been created, you should now see it on the New Game page
- Upload the json file tht matches the game in the 'Choose File' box, and then click 'Import Tweets'

If you did everything correctly, then you should be able to return to the home page and see the newly added game, then visit the new game page with all of the neat data.

If you did something wrong, you might be able to delete some of the data, or the game and start over. If not, you might be in a mess that would require a re-deploy.

If you have any questions, you can call Jason Harris at literally any time of day, or night, at 254-220-5155.
